          FitHub is a simple workout app built with React. It helps users learn
          new exercises, log their workouts, and track progress over time.
        
          You can browse different exercises with images and instructions, add
          your own workouts with sets and reps, and view your workout history.
       
          This project was created to practice React concepts like components,
          props, state, and local storage.
